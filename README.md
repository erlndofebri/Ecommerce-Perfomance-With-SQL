### Annual Customer Activity Growth Analysis
There is an increase in the average number of users per month annualy. In 2016, data start recorded on September, so the values become smaller than other years. by looking at the difference in the increment 2017-2018, there is still space for user growth in the following years. This indicates that the company has good growth in increasing the number of users. We need to do further analysis what cause of increasing customer and how we can maintain it.

### Annual Customer Activity Growth Analysis
In average, our customers only buy once every year. In the long run, this is not good for our company, we have to increase order frequency to get more loyal customer. In the long run, maintaining loyal customer is the way more cheaper and more profitable than gaining the new one.

### Annual Product Category Quality Analysis
Although 2016 was recorded from September, based on the 2017-2018 difference in the revenue variable and the number of items canceled, we can conclude that there is an increase in revenue and the number of items canceled every year. The interesting thing here is that in 2018 the category that greatly contributed to revenue and the number of items canceled was the category, this indicates that in that year there was a trend in the category. Further analysis can be done to confirm this.

### Analysis of Annual Payment Type Usage 
In general, with the same asumption as before, every year each type of payment has increased, this can happen due to the addition of the number of users every year. And there are a few payments that are not recorded where they come from, this is possible because of bugs, system errors, or other technical things.
